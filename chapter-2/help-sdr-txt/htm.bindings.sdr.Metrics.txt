Help on class Metrics in htm.bindings.sdr:

htm.bindings.sdr.Metrics = class Metrics(pybind11_builtins.pybind11_object)
 |  Measures an SDR.  This applies the following three metrics:
 |       Sparsity
 |       ActivationFrequency
 |       Overlap
 |  This accumulates measurements using an exponential moving average, and
 |  outputs a summary of results.
 |  
 |  Example Usage:
 |      A = SDR( dimensions = 2000 )
 |      M = Metrics( A, period = 1000 )
 |      A.randomize( 0.10 )
 |      for i in range( 20 ):
 |          A.addNoise( 0.55 )
 |  
 |      M.sparsity            -> Sparsity class instance
 |      M.activationFrequency -> ActivationFrequency class instance
 |      M.overlap             -> Overlap class instance
 |      str(M) -> SDR( 2000 )
 |                  Sparsity Min/Mean/Std/Max 0.1 / 0.1 / 0 / 0.1
 |                  Activation Frequency Min/Mean/Std/Max 0 / 0.1 / 0.100464 / 0.666667
 |                  Entropy 0.822222
 |                  Overlap Min/Mean/Std/Max 0.45 / 0.45 / 0 / 0.45

 |      __init__(*args, **kwargs)
 |      Overloaded function.
 |      
 |      1. __init__(self: htm.bindings.sdr.Metrics, sdr: htm.bindings.sdr.SDR, period: int) -> None
 |      
 |      Argument sdr is data source to track.  Add data to this Metrics instance
 |      by assigning to this SDR.
 |      
 |      Argument period is time constant for exponential moving average.
 |      
 |      2. __init__(self: htm.bindings.sdr.Metrics, dimensions: List[int], period: int) -> None
 |      
 |      Argument dimensions of SDR.  Add data to this Metrics instance
 |      by calling method metrics.addData( SDR ) with an SDR which has these dimensions.
 |      
 |      Argument period is time constant for exponential moving average.
 |  
 |  __str__(...)
 |      __str__(self: htm.bindings.sdr.Metrics) -> object
 |  
 |  addData(...)
 |      addData(self: htm.bindings.sdr.Metrics, sdr: htm.bindings.sdr.SDR) -> None
 |      
 |      Add an SDR datum to these Metrics.  This method can only be called if
 |      Metrics was constructed with dimensions and NOT an SDR.
 |      
 |      Argument sdr is data source, its dimensions must be the same as this Metric's
 |      dimensions.
 |  
 |  reset(...)
 |      reset(self: htm.bindings.sdr.Metrics) -> None
 |      
 |      For use with time-series data sets.
